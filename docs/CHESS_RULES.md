# ♟️ Chess Clash - Game Rules & Implementation

## 🎯 Core Chess Rules Implementation

### 📋 Board Setup & Initial Position
🏁 **Standard 8x8 board** with alternating light and dark squares creating the cosmic battlefield

👑 **Piece placement** follows traditional chess starting positions with space-themed visual representations

🎨 **Coordinate system** uses algebraic notation (a1-h8) for move recording and game analysis

⚡ **Turn-based gameplay** with white (Federation) always moving first in each match

### 🚀 Piece Movement Rules

#### 👑 King (Command Ship)
🎯 **Movement** → One square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)

🛡️ **Special ability** → Cannot move into check or capture defended pieces

🏰 **Castling rights** → Can castle kingside/queenside under specific conditions

⚠️ **Victory condition** → Game ends when king is checkmated or stalemated

#### ♕ Queen (Battlecruiser)
💫 **Movement** → Unlimited squares in any direction (combines rook + bishop movement)

⚡ **Power level** → Most versatile piece with maximum battlefield control

🎯 **Strategic value** → Worth approximately 9 points in material evaluation

🚀 **Combat range** → Can capture any enemy piece within line of sight

#### 🏰 Rook (Space Station)
📏 **Movement** → Unlimited squares horizontally or vertically only

🔒 **Castling partner** → Participates in castling maneuver with the king

🎯 **Strategic value** → Worth approximately 5 points in material evaluation

⚡ **Endgame power** → Becomes increasingly powerful as board opens up

#### 🐎 Knight (Fighter Jet)
🌟 **Movement** → L-shaped pattern: 2 squares in one direction, 1 square perpendicular

🚀 **Jump ability** → Only piece that can leap over other pieces

🎯 **Strategic value** → Worth approximately 3 points in material evaluation

🎪 **Tactical weapon** → Excellent for forks, pins, and surprise attacks

#### ⛪ Bishop (Satellite Array)
📡 **Movement** → Unlimited squares diagonally only

🎨 **Color binding** → Each player has one light-squared and one dark-squared bishop

🎯 **Strategic value** → Worth approximately 3 points in material evaluation

⚡ **Long-range power** → Controls diagonal corridors across the battlefield

#### ⚔️ Pawn (Scout Ship)
🎯 **Forward movement** → One square forward, or two squares on first move

⚔️ **Capture method** → Diagonally forward one square only

🌟 **Promotion reward** → Transforms into any piece (except king) upon reaching opposite end

🎪 **En passant** → Special capture rule for pawns that move two squares initially

### 🎮 Special Moves & Advanced Rules

#### 🏰 Castling Maneuver
✅ **Requirements** → King and rook must not have moved previously

🛡️ **Safety check** → King cannot be in check before, during, or after castling

🚀 **Execution** → King moves 2 squares toward rook, rook jumps to opposite side

⚡ **Strategic purpose** → Combines king safety with rook development

#### 🎪 En Passant Capture
🎯 **Trigger condition** → Enemy pawn moves two squares, landing beside your pawn

⏰ **Time limit** → Must be executed immediately on the next turn only

🚀 **Capture method** → Your pawn captures diagonally to the empty square behind enemy pawn

⚡ **Result** → Enemy pawn is removed from the board despite not being directly attacked

#### 🌟 Pawn Promotion
🎯 **Activation** → Occurs when pawn reaches the opposite end of the board

🚀 **Transformation options** → Queen, rook, bishop, or knight (player's choice)

💫 **Strategic consideration** → Usually promote to queen for maximum power

🎪 **Underpromotion** → Sometimes knight or rook promotion creates better tactical opportunities

### ⚠️ Check & Checkmate Conditions

#### 🚨 Check Status
⚠️ **Definition** → King is under direct attack and must be addressed immediately

🛡️ **Response options** → Move king to safety, block attack, or capture attacking piece

🎯 **Notation** → Marked with "+" symbol in algebraic notation

⚡ **Continuous threat** → Player cannot make moves that leave their king in check

#### 💀 Checkmate Victory
🏆 **Win condition** → King is in check with no legal moves to escape capture

🎯 **Game termination** → Immediate victory for the attacking player

👑 **Ultimate goal** → Primary objective of every chess game

⚡ **Tactical patterns** → Common checkmate patterns include back rank, smothered mate, etc.

#### 🤝 Stalemate Draw
🎭 **Definition** → Player has no legal moves but king is not in check

🤝 **Result** → Game ends in a draw (tie) regardless of material advantage

⚡ **Strategic consideration** → Sometimes used as defensive resource in losing positions

🎯 **Prevention** → Winning player must maintain legal moves for opponent

### 🎲 Additional Draw Conditions

#### 🔄 Threefold Repetition
📊 **Rule** → Same position occurs three times with same player to move

🤝 **Result** → Either player can claim a draw

⏰ **Tracking** → Game engine automatically monitors position repetition

🎯 **Strategic use** → Often employed to avoid losing positions

#### 📏 50-Move Rule
⏰ **Condition** → 50 moves pass without pawn move or piece capture

🤝 **Draw claim** → Either player can request draw after 50-move threshold

🎯 **Reset triggers** → Pawn moves and captures reset the counter to zero

⚡ **Endgame relevance** → Prevents infinite games in theoretical endgames

#### 💀 Insufficient Material
🎭 **Scenarios** → King vs king, king+bishop vs king, king+knight vs king

🤝 **Automatic draw** → Game engine declares draw when checkmate is impossible

⚡ **Material combinations** → Certain piece combinations cannot force checkmate
